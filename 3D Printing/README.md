# 3D printed parts

##Â 3D printer
We mainly use an [Ultimaker S5](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/ultimaker-s5) for production
3D printing.

## Materials
The material used for 3D printed parts of the CORDOVA-ET is white PETG from
[Smart Materials 3D](https://www.smartmaterials3d.com/en/home/24-petg.html#/size-750g/shoes_size-2_85_mm/colour-white).
After several tests, this is the material that showed the best resistance
to harsh outdoor conditions.

In the pyranometer, we have used [Black ASA](https://www.smartmaterials3d.com/en/home/196-asa.html#/size-750g/shoes_size-1_75mm/colour-black)
in the second extruder for providing mate black inline to avoid extra radiation
reaching the radiation sensor.

## Pyranometer
It is composed of the Pyranometer enclosure and the cover. For the cover
it needs to be printed with a dual extruder 3D printed using white PETG and black ASA

## Air temperature and humidity sensor support
The SHT3x is attached to a vertical mount attached to the pyranometer using two
screws. The sensor can be mounted using tiny screws or a small pice of wire.

## Infrared Thermometer Case
The Melexis sensor is housed in a case that allows to mount the sensor on a vertical
bar. The two parts are assembled together using two small screws.
